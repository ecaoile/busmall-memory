Write user stories for each possible role. User stories follow the format of: As a ___, I want ___ so that ___. Remember, user stories tell...

Who needs a feature (and a brief descriptor of their role/relationship to the app)
What they want that feature to do
Why they want it
If you want a feature in the app, you MUST have at least one user story (preferably more, if multiple users want it) that requires it. No exceptions.

Write your user stories in a user-stories.md file in your repo.
